            <h4>A client recently sold their business and was due to receive a large deposit into their high street bank account.</h4>
          <p>
            The large transactions caused their existing bank to freeze their account on multiple occasions, creating numerous delays and frustrations to the client. As a result, the client approached their Partner to understand whether there any alternative options available to them. 
             The client was introduced to one of our private banks who were able to take a more personalised approach, understanding their particular needs, with the client now receiving an excellent and professional service tailored to their new level of wealth and banking requirements.</p>
